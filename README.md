# Food ordering fullstack application with NextJS and Strapi

Inspired from the NextJS tutorial at Strapi, I am recreating the application with my own personal twist.

I am also adding Typescript as it was not in the tutorial.

## Features

- NextJS
- Strapi
- React-bootstrap
- Typescript
- Eslint with Airbnb
- Apollo client with GraphQL
- Automatically generate types with Apollo CLI

## Future features

- MongoDB
- Authentication

More to come ...
